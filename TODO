TODO:

  * Add an API to deal with the breakpoints
    + Creation/deletion
    + List current breakpoints
    + Disable/enable ?
    + Conditional ? => Might be tricky.

  * Do the GDB interface thing
    + Design the CLI (something close to the C debugging stuff)

  * Enhance variable handling:
    + List currently reachable variables (for autocompletion)
    + Assign a value to a variable

  * Module destruction
    + Find a way to automatically release the resources allocated in ldbcore => empty userdata with destructor ?
