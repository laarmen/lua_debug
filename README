ldb
===

ldb is a tentative debugger for Lua that uses the builtin debug
facilities and a unix socket to control the lua program flow in a Python
script.

The initial objective is to embed this script into gdb to be able to switch
easily from C debugging to lua debugging, although first a standalone debugger
would be quite nice already.

Patches welcome :)
